# Features

- Subsequent notes are related to the previous note through gaussian probability distributions leading to better flow
- Notes more likely generated on strong beats (1/3) for an enhanced sense of rhythm
- Special features such as bends and slides can be generated
- Bad luck protection so tablature is never empty
